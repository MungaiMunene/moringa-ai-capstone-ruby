**Title:** *Prompt-Powered Kickstart: Building a Beginner’s Toolkit for Ruby*
**Author:** Mungai Munene

## 📍 Overview
This project demonstrates how generative AI can accelerate learning a new technology — in this case, Ruby — by building both a CLI tool and a mini Web API with Sinatra. It includes clear documentation, working examples, an AI prompt journal, and troubleshooting guidance.

## 🎯 Goals
- Use AI prompts to quickly learn Ruby fundamentals.
- Build two runnable examples:
  1. CLI Greeting Tool — interactive Ruby script.
  2. Mini Web API with Sinatra — simple API with /hello and /greet endpoints.
- Document the process so beginners can replicate it easily.

## 🛠️ Deliverables
- Codebase:
  - src/greet.rb (CLI script).
  - src/app.rb (Sinatra web API).
- Toolkit Documentation:
  - Setup instructions.
  - Examples with expected outputs.
  - AI Prompt Journal (installation, scripts, API, fixes).
  - Troubleshooting section (Ruby version mismatch, Bundler, WEBrick, port conflicts).
  - References.
- README.md: Quick start guide for running locally.

## ✅ Achievements
- Successfully installed Ruby via Homebrew and resolved system vs. user Ruby conflicts.
- Built and tested both CLI and API examples.
- Logged iterative use of AI to resolve errors (Bundler, WEBrick, ports).
- Documented end-to-end workflow, ensuring reproducibility.
## 🚀 Key Takeaway
Generative AI is a practical learning companion — enabling faster setup, guiding troubleshooting, and boosting confidence when approaching unfamiliar technologies.
