# Moringa AI Capstone â€“ Ruby Beginnerâ€™s Toolkit

This project is my capstone for the **Moringa AI course**, where I used generative AI to learn a new technology â€” in this case, **Ruby**.  
The toolkit demonstrates two beginner-friendly examples:  

1. **CLI Greeting Tool** â€“ a command-line script that asks for your name and greets you.  
2. **Mini Web API** â€“ a simple API built with Sinatra that responds with text and JSON.
